# AsbestOS

This repository contains a little x86 kernel I'm developing to get knowledge in operating system development.

The kernel is written in assembly and C, featuring its own libc implementation.

## Building

Building this OS requires gcc, gnu binutils & gnu make. Use the following command:
```console
$ make
```

## Running

Running this OS requires qemu being installed. Use the following command:
```console
$ make run
```
